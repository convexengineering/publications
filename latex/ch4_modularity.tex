\chapter{Flexibility and modularity of GPkit models}

In this section, we will abandon the SimPleAC, and move to examine one of the
most sophisticated models and largest models to come out of the CEG, SPaircraft.
SPaircraft is a commercial aircraft design tool that makes use of component-
based performance modeling to optimize different configurations of aircraft in
both single- and multi-mission scenarios.

\section{Component-based design}

\section{Example problem: Creating a modular tail structural model}

Consider the set of equations considered in \cite{SP_ac_design} to size
the structure of a conventional horizontal tail. 

\begin{align}
    0.92 w\tau_{\rm{ht}} t_{\rm{cap}}^2 + I_{\rm{cap}} &\leq \frac{0.92^2}{2}w\tau_{\rm{ht}}^2t_{\rm{cap}}\\
    8 &\geq N_{\rm{lift}}M_{\rm{r}}(\AR_{\rm{ht}})q_{\rm{ht}}^2\frac{\tau_{\rm{ht}}}{S_{\rm{ht}} I_{\rm{cap}}\sigma_{\rm{max}}}\\
    12 &\geq \frac{L_{\rm{max}} N_{\rm{lift}} q^2}{\tau_{\rm{ht}} S t_{\rm{web}} \sigma_{\rm{max-shear}}}
\end{align}

Now, using a set of variables that includes the original parametrization of the wing, 
we would like to extend this structural model to be able to design a pi horizontal tail
with the same loading. 

This section will derive a new set of constraints, which are compatible with 
both conventional tail and pi-tail architectures, and in the process demonstrate the 
capabilities of \gls{GP} in incremental design. 

\subsection{Assumptions}

But firstly, we have to make assumptions about the structure of the problem to be able to 
model 

Furthermore, we would like to err on the side of conservatism always, since we would
rather be in a more restricted and realistic subset of the design space, rather than 
expanding our feasible set to include solutions that are optimistic and infeasible. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{The lift per unit span is proportional to local chord.} This allows 
    us to neglect the effects of lift rolloff towards the wingtips, which is difficult
    to model in a \gls{GP} framework.  Since the horizontal tail model will 
    be more heavily loaded towards its wingtips than an actual tail, the loads
    on the tail model are conservative. 
    \item \textbf{The horizontal tail has a constant taper ratio.} This geometry 
    assumption is made we would like to start with a basic parametrization first. 
    Constant taper tail sections are also observed in real aircraft. 
    Higher degrees of freedom in horizontal tail chord are considered unnecessary 
    (although they could be modeled, explained further in Section~\ref{sec:HTExtensions}). 
    \item \textbf{The horizontal and vertical tail joint is a fuselage width away from 
the centerline of the aircraft.} In the pi-tail configuration the vertical tails are 
often canted outward for aerodynamic benefits. However, we would like to avoid making 
assumptions about this, and make the conservative approximation that the vertical tails
are perfectly vertical, and join the fuselage and the horizontal tail at $w_{fuse}$, the
width of the fuselage.
    \item \textbf{The horizontal and vertical tail interface is a pin joint.} This implies 
    that the joint does not exert a moment on the horizontal tail, and a conservative 
    assumption from an engineering perspective. We do not want to expose such a fine 
    interface to moments that may cause failure. \label{item:pinjoint}
    \item \textbf{The shear and moment distributions on the horizontal tail are 
    linearized.} The reasons for this assumption will become more clear in 
    Section~\ref{sec:HTloads}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Loads on a horizontal tail}
\label{sec:HTloads}

As with a majority of \gls{GP} formulations, we have to consider the fundamental physics to 
be able to derive a new set of constraints. 

\subsubsection{Sample Free Body Diagram and Load Distributions}
\label{s:loadDistributions}

With the aforementioned assumptions, the free body diagram diagram of the 
pi-tail is shown at the top of Figure~\ref{fig:HTFBD}. 

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth,natwidth=585,natheight=442]{HTFBD.pdf}
\caption{Free body diagram of the forces on the horizontal tail. The distributed 
lift force, which is assumed to be proportional to local chord, is partitioned 
into triangular and rectangular components.}
\label{fig:HTFBD}
\end{figure}

Shear and moment diagrams are presented in Figures~\ref{fig:HTshear} and 
\ref{fig:HTmoment} respectively. The diagrams include both the distributed lift 
loads (green arrows in Figure \ref{fig:HTFBD}) and the point loads of imposed on 
the pin joints by the vertical tails.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.7\linewidth,natwidth=621,natheight=428]{HTshear.pdf}
    \caption{Shear diagram of the pi-tail. The blue line shows the actual 
loading, while the yellow line with infill shows the assumed load distribution.}
    \label{fig:HTshear}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.7\linewidth,natwidth=627,natheight=437]{HTmoment.pdf}
    \caption{Moment diagram of the pi-tail. The blue line shows the actual 
loading, and the yellow line shows the assumed load distribution}
    \label{fig:HTmoment}
\end{figure}

After having seen these diagrams, we can make 

The pi horizontal tail becomes a conventional tail in the limit where $w_{fuse} \xrightarrow[]{} 0$. 


After seeing these load distributions, an experienced \gls{GP} modeler would immediately think about linearization. 



The pin-joint assumption ensures the vertical tail structural constraints do not 
need to be modified for the pi-tail configuration.

\end{tabbing}

\subsubsection{Load Derivation}

$L_{\rm{ht}_{rect}}$ is defined to be half the lift generated by the `rectangular' 
section of the wing (the blue rectangle in Figure~\ref{fig:HTFBD}).

\begin{equation}
    L_{\rm{ht}_{rect}} \geq \frac{L_{\rm{ht}_{\rm{max}}} c_{\rm{tip}_{\rm{ht}}} b_{\rm{ht}}}{2 S_{\rm{ht}}}
\end{equation}

Similarly, $L_{\rm{ht}_{\rm{tri}}}$ is defined to be half the lift generated by the 
`triangular' section of the wing (the blue triangle in Figure~\ref{fig:HTFBD}).
 
\begin{equation}
     L_{\rm{ht}_{\rm{\rm{tri}}}} \geq \frac{L_{\rm{ht}_{\rm{max}}} (1 - \lambda_{\rm{ht}}) c_{\rm{root}_{\rm{ht}}} b_{\rm{ht}}}{4 
S_{\rm{ht}}}
\end{equation}
 
After defining the horizontal tail half-span outboard of the pin joint 
($b_{\rm{ht}_{\rm{out}}}$), the outboard components of the lift loads   can be computed 
with respect to $L_{\rm{ht}_{rect}}$ and $L_{\rm{ht}_{\rm{tri}}}$. The outboard loads are shown 
in red in Figure~\ref{fig:HTFBD}. 
 
 \begin{align}
     b_{\rm{ht}_{\rm{out}}} &\geq 0.5b_{\rm{ht}} - w_{\textrm{fuse}}\\
     L_{\rm{ht}_{tri_{\rm{out}}}} &\geq L_{\rm{ht}_{\rm{tri}}} \frac{b_{\rm{ht}_{\rm{out}}}}{(0.5b_{\rm{ht}})^2}\\
     L_{\rm{ht}_{\rm{rect}_{\rm{out}}}} &\geq L_{\rm{ht}_{rect}} \frac{b_{\rm{ht}_{\rm{out}}}}{0.5b_{\rm{ht}}}
 \end{align}
 
The horizontal-vertical tail pin joint is assumed to be exactly at $w_{\textrm{fuse}}$. 
This is a conservative estimate. In most pi-tail configurations the vertical 
tails are canted outwards. The local chord at the pin joint is constrained with 
the following monomial equality.
 
\begin{equation}
    c_{\rm{attach}} = \frac{b_{\rm{ht}} \lambda_{\rm{ht}} c_{\rm{root}_{\rm{ht}}}}{2 w_{\textrm{fuse}}}
\end{equation}
 
The maximum moment at the joint is determined by summing the bending moment 
contributions from loads outboard of the joint. 
\begin{equation}
M_{\rm{r}_{\rm{out}}} c_{\rm{attach}} \geq 
                    L_{\rm{ht}_{\rm{rect}_{\rm{out}}}} \frac{1}{2}b_{\rm{ht}_{\rm{out}}} + 
L_{\rm{ht}_{tri_{\rm{out}}}} \frac{1}{3}b_{\rm{ht}_{\rm{out}}},
\end{equation}
 
The maximum shear at the joint is the sum of the outboard shear loads. The 
maximum root moment is the sum of the bending loads from lift and the pin-joint 
load. 
 
\begin{align}
L_{\rm{shear}} &\geq L_{\rm{ht}_{\rm{rect}_{\rm{out}}}} + L_{\rm{ht}_{tri{\rm{out}}}}\\
M_{\rm{r}} c_{\rm{root}_{\rm{ht}}} &\geq L_{\rm{ht}_{\rm{rect}}} \frac{1}{4}b_{\rm{ht}} + L_{\rm{ht}_{\rm{\rm{tri}}}} 
\frac{1}{6}b_{\rm{ht}}  - \frac{1}{2}L_{\rm{ht}_{\rm{max}}} w_{\textrm{fuse}} 
\end{align}

Finally, the wingtip moment is set equal to zero with a signomial equality 
constraint.

\begin{equation}
    \frac{b_{\rm{ht}}}{4} L_{\rm{ht}_{\rm{rect}}} + \frac{b_{\rm{ht}}}{3} L_{\rm{ht}_{\rm{\rm{tri}}}} = b_{\rm{ht}_{\rm{out}}} 
\frac{L_{\rm{ht}_{\rm{max}}}}{2}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Structural Sizing}

Equations from \cite{gp_ac_design} for wing structural sizing were adapted using 
a linearization of the moment and shear load distributions from Appendix E2. The 
constraints can be applied to both conventional and pi-tails.

\begin{align}
    0.92 w\tau_{\rm{ht}} t_{\rm{cap}}^2 + I_{\rm{cap}} &\leq \frac{0.92^2}{2}w\tau_{\rm{ht}}^2t_{\rm{cap}}\\
    8 &\geq N_{\rm{lift}}M_{\rm{r}_{\rm{out}}}(\AR_{\rm{ht}})q_{\rm{ht}}^2\frac{\tau_{\rm{ht}}}{S_{\rm{ht}} I_{\rm{cap}}\sigma_{\rm{max}}}\\
    12 &\geq \frac{2L_{\rm{shear}} N_{\rm{lift}} q^2}{\tau_{\rm{ht}} S t_{\rm{web}} \sigma_{\rm{max-shear}}}
\end{align}

The changes to the model in \cite{gp_ac_design} are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item In the shear constraint replacing $L_{\rm{ht}_{\rm{max}}}$ with $2L_{\rm{shear}}$. 
This is done because the shear loads for the pi-tail are different than the 
maximum lift loads for the conventional tail. 
    \item Replacing $M_{\rm{r}}$ with $M_{\rm{r}_{\rm{out}}}$, the moment per unit chord at the 
pin joint. For a pi-tail, maximum bending loads occur at the pin joint.
    %, and along with the root moment per unit chord $M_{\rm{r}}$ can be used to give a 
    %conservative approximation for the mass of the horizontal tail. 
\end{itemize}

The linearization of the shear and bending load distributions simplifies the 
derivation of the structural web and cap weights. Shear web sizing relies on the 
assumption that the maximum shear ($L_{\rm{shear}}$) occurs at the pin-joint and the 
weight of the shear web of the pi-tail under $L_{\rm{shear}}$ is equal to the shear 
web weight of a conventional tail subjected to the the same maximum shear load 
at its root. This is a conservative approximation, the load distribution implied 
by this assumption (shown in yellow in Figure~\ref{fig:HTshear}) has a larger 
internal area than the actual load distribution. Intuitively, the $L_{\rm{shear}}$ 
for a pi-tail is strictly smaller than the $L_{\rm{shear}}$ a conventional tail of 
the same size and loading. The pi-tail more efficient in shear.

The cap weight of the pi-tail is determined by scaling the cap weight of a 
conventional tail with the same geometry as the pi-tail and a root moment of 
$M_{\rm{r}_{\rm{out}}} c_{\rm{attach}}$. The scaling factor, $\pi_{\rm{M-fac}}$, is the ratio of the 
total shaded bending moment area in Figure~\ref{fig:HTmoment} to the sum of the 
outboard shaded areas multiplied by the ratio of the outboard half-span to the 
total half-span.

\begin{equation}
    \pi_{\rm{M-fac}} \geq \left[\frac{\frac{1}{2}(M_{\rm{r}_{\rm{out}}} c_{\rm{attach}} +
    M_{\rm{r}} c_{\rm{root}_{\rm{ht}}}) w_{\textrm{fuse}}} {\frac{1}{2}M_{\rm{r}_{\rm{out}}} c_{\rm{attach}} 
b_{\rm{ht}_{\rm{out}}}} + 1.0\right]
    \frac{b_{\rm{ht}_{\rm{out}}}} {0.5b_{\rm{ht}}},
\end{equation}

Given the calculated loads and structural factors, the bending material and 
shear web weight can be calculated. 

\begin{align}
    W_{\rm{cap}} &\geq \frac{\pi_{\rm{M-fac}} 8 \rho_{\rm{cap}} g w t_{\rm{cap}} S_{\rm{ht}}^1.5 \nu}
    {3\AR_{\rm{ht}}^{0.5}}\\
    W_{\rm{web}} &\geq \frac{8 \rho_{\rm{web}} g r_h \tau_{\rm{ht}} t_{\rm{web}} S_{\rm{ht}}^{1.5} 
\nu}{3\AR_{\rm{ht}}^{0.5}}\\
    W_{\rm{struct}} &\geq W_{\rm{web}} + W_{\rm{cap}}
\end{align}

The value for $t_{\rm{cap}}$ is notional in the derivation above. Rather than being 
the spar cap thickness of a pi-tail, it is the spar cap thickness required for a 
conventional tail of the same geometry and a root moment  ($M_{\rm{r}_{\rm{out}}} 
c_{\rm{attach}}$) as a pi-tail. With a similar reasoning as for the shear loads, 
$\pi_{\rm{M-fac}} t_{\rm{cap}}$ for a pi-tail is strictly smaller than the $t_{\rm{cap}}$ for a 
conventional tail of the same geometry and loading, making the pi-tail more 
efficient in bending than a traditional tail.

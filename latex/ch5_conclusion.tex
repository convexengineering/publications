\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{ch5:conclusion}

This thesis has demonstrated methods to modeling and optimization using \gls{GP}. It
is motivated by the need to reduce the activation energy of designers in using
optimization to perform conceptual design. The \gls{GP} and \gls{SP} are the
mathematical frameworks that enable the intuitive formulation of general
physical relations into optimization-compatible constraints.

In Chapter~\ref{ch2:inequalities}, the ideas of pressure and boundedness were
defined in the context of a \gls{GP}, to show the intuitive nature of \gls{GP}
compatible constraints. The basic aircraft design problem was defined,
and the importance of objective functions and variable freedom
was identified in achieving bounded convex problems.
Section~\ref{s:GPlimits} provided justification for the need to use the non-convex
extension of \gls{GP}s called \gls{SP}s in design, with some loss of mathematical
guarantees and solution speed. Fuel volume models provided a meaningful use
case for signomial constraints, and the chapter provided arguments for the use of the signomial
equality. The product was an \gls{SP}-compatible aircraft model that was systematically defined from
physical principles, and a sample solution of that model.

Chapter~\ref{ch3:extensibility} begun by introducing the idea of modularity, and improving
the fidelity of models by using data-based modeling in Section~\ref{s:engine}.
The aircraft model was modularized
into component models, and then into performance and static models in order to
be able to vectorize certain sets of variables and constraints that are repeated between
different mission segments. A logical (but non-unique) hierarchy of models
was presented to allow designers to make decisions about where to locate different variables
and constraints in the modular mission model architecture.

The chapter also presented a case where environmental modeling becomes critical
for designs we trust as engineers. While performing tradespace exploration, an intuitive
way to analyze the components of a multi-objective cost of the \gls{GP} was presented, in
an effort to draw maximal engineering understanding from the tradespaces that were explored.

Before expanding the a multimission framework in Section~\ref{s:multimission},
the SimPleAC engine model was improved upon
in response to the sensitivity information. Potential
new objective functions were identified and implemented in the context of multimission design
and optimization.
A sample solution of a 2-mission multimission aircraft design
was presented alongside two aircraft optimized for each mission alone to further motivate
the use of multimission \gls{MDO}.

The author demonstrated how to model a complex engineering system
starting from scratch in \gls{GP} and \gls{SP}, and extract engineering understanding of
the trade spaces using tools and methods developed in the \gls{CEG}.
Although an aircraft design problem was the focus of the thesis,
these methods are general to engineering design problems with explicit, continuous constraints,
and help lower the barriers to using optimization in engineering design.

\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{ch5:conclusion}

%TODO: much to do here...
TO BE COMPLETED.

This thesis serves to demonstrate methods in \gls{GP} modeling and optimization
rather than provide interesting results, so I will

In Chapter~\ref{ch2:inequalities},

I have defined an aircraft model to show the intuitive nature of \gls{GP}
compatible constraints, and demonstrated how to model a complex
starting from scratch

I concluded with describing the use cases for signomial equalities.

In Chapter~\ref{ch3:extensibility}, I have first presented an intuitive
way to analyze the solution of the \gls{GP}, and draw maximal engineering
understanding from it. I have expanded upon the SimPleAC engine model
in response to the sensitivity information to improve its fidelity,
and modularized it into both component models, and performance and static models.


%In Chapter~\ref{ch4:modularity}, I have presented SPaircraft, one of the more
%advanced \gls{SP} models made in GPkit. I have demonstrated how to model
%a complex component such as the horizontal tail within the GP framework,
%while making it compatible with different potential tail configurations.

\chapter{Introduction}

Modern engineering design, and particularly aerospace design, has come to rely
heavily on optimization. Time and time again, the importance of fast and
reliable MDO tools has been stressed in the literature. However most MDO tools
have the downfalls of being slow due to the multimodal nature of many
engineering design problems.
	
In the \gls{CEG}, we seek to improve the engineering design process by
leveraging the mathematical guarantees and speed of convex optimization. We develop
open-source, object-oriented software to help build \gls{GP}-compatible models and
interface with solvers. In much of our previous work
(\cite{gp_ac_design},\cite{SP_ac_design}, \cite{sp_engine}), we have demonstrated that
\gls{GP} is useful for optimization, but have yet to formalize why it
facilitates design.
 
The mathematical restrictions on the form of constraints remains the biggest
barrier in the implementation of convex programs in design. Firstly, this thesis
will aim to show that the form of the GP actually facilitates the design process
and engineering understanding, rather than impeding it, through the disciplined use
of inequalities to express constraints. Hence it will aim to
pass on some of the expertise we have developed in the \gls{CEG} building
\gls{GP}-compatible models from general non-linear physical models. 

Secondly, it will aim to showcase the extensibility of \gls{GP} that is superior 
to other optimization formulations. The formulation of the \gls{GP} as a 'bag of 
constraints' instead of a hierarchial set of relations confers advantages 
when trying to expand the fidelity and scope of models, especially in the 
conceptual design stage. 

Finally, this thesis will discuss the features specific to GPkit in facilitating
an engineering design process that is streamlined and collaborative, and is
compatible with modern engineering design methodologies. The modularity of the 
models allows for a component-based design approach that ensures that designs 
satisfy the requirements both at the sub-system and complete-system levels. 
Furthermore, GPkit allows feedback between design engineers and models
which allows targeted efforts by engineers to collaboratively improve models.

\section{Defining Design versus Optimization} \label{sec:DesVsOpt}

It is difficult to find rigorous definitions of design and optimization that
try to identify the similarities and differences between the terms. For us to be
able to understand why \gls{GP}s facilitate design, we have to determine what 
features of optimization create barriers to entry for its use in design. 

\subsection{What is design?}

In the context of this paper, I will define design as the following:
	To design is to conceive the form and function of something. 

In the engineering sense, we think about the form as the configuration. 
In the product development sense, the form has more of an esthetic quality. 

The function is the actual purpose of the things being designed. It is oftentimes 
the aspect of the design that we can quantify (i.e. the performance). 

An important aspect of design is that it is a process. 

The underlying conclusion is that, to an optimization engineer, the classical 
definition of design implies a class of feasibility problems, given a set
of functional requirements. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Ned's comment: Parametrization and physics. Hard to agree on a representation 
that we all agree on. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{What is optimization?}

Optimization has a rigorous mathematical definition: To optimize is to select an 
element in a set of feasible solutions with the lowest desired objective
function value. 

It is also a process, which is sensitive to the elements contained within the set
(related to the form), and the choice of objective function (related to the 
function).

In many ways, optimization is a natural extension of design, because it allows 
for an explicit mathematical representation of the form and function.

\subsection{The fundamental differences}

To many engineers, design and optimization are one and the same. However, 

\begin{itemize}
\item Design is human-driven. Optimization is computational. 
\item Design is based on feasibility. Optimization is based on the mathematical 
guarantees of optimality. 
\item Design can be done in non-restrictive mathematical forms. Optimization is 
done in specific mathematical forms that take advantage of structure. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Unifying design and optimization using gls{GP}}

\gls{GP} has developed "in response to a need to solve problems in the actual 
world".~\cite{duffingp} Quote from Duffin, 1967, main inventor of GP.

(Each section in this part of the intro has a corresponding section in the body.
(Each will feature an example problem that I will run through as a
(demonstration.)

There are three primary reasons why...

\begin{enumerate}     \item \textit{Inequalities help engineering
understanding.}

The mathematical constraints of \gls{GP} force designers to have a proper grasp
of the fundamental tradeoffs and pressures in a design.

Inequalities make feasible sets explicit. ADD A DIAGRAM OF FEASIBLE SETS using
SimPleAC HERE.

Traditionally, physical relations are expressed as equalities. But there is an
almost-seamless transition from fundamental physics to GP-compatible
constraints. ENGINEERS LIKE +VE QUANTITIES. eg. downforce vs. negative lift.

And even if the tradeoffs are not clear, we can use signomial equalities to
enforce constraints.

    \item \textit{Models are extensible.}
    
Models can be made arbitrarily complex. The 'bag of constraints' form of the GP
means that there is no need to reformulate the optimization scheme as more
constraints are added. This makes incremental modeling improvements possible and
even preferable.

The traditional engineering design process is split into conceptual, preliminary
and critical design segments. GP modeling facilitates this process by allowing
ever-increasing levels of complexity.

Gradient based optimization methods for multimodal systems often involves
converge loops, which have to be reengineered when new constraints are
introduced. VS. adding constraints to a bag...

We can effectively use sensitivity information to determine which parts of the
model yield the greatest returns to improved modeling, so engineers can target
their efforts.

    \item \textit{Models are flexible and modular, and compatible with modern
    engineering design (similar to extensible?)}

(This is a feature of GPkit, and not GPs in general.) \gls{GP}s make it easy to
implement component-based modeling, and build models that are shared between
different design problems. Each component has associated sizing and performance
variables.

This is helped by the fact that underconstrained \gls{GP}s can solve reliably,
and the tightness of constraints can be monitored.

\end{enumerate}

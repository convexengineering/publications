A conventional aircraft can be thought to have climb and cruise segments

\subsection{Mission design unearths weaknesses in models.}

Mission design often exploits the weaknesses of existing models to arrive at solutions
that do not seem physical. In this
specific modeling example, it shows the weaknesses of the engine model.


The first weakness is the fact that the engine can supply the same amount of power
regardless of altitude. \gls{GP} can help us observe this behavior by allowing engineers to
evaluate a number of optimal designs quickly, and enabling the observation of trends.
For naturally aspirated piston engines, we would expect the maximum power available to
drop with altitude; adding such a lapse rate will improve the fidelity of the engine.

THe second is the lack of

\section{Multimission design}

Having created a mission profile for the SimPleAC, it only takes one extra level of
hierarchy to do multimission design. Now we vectorize the performance
and atmosphere models that are flown by the same aircraft.

Geometric programs (GPs) and other forms of convex optimization have recently experienced
a resurgence due to polynomial-time algorithms and improvements in computing.
Observing the need for fast and stable methods for multidisciplinary
design optimization,
previous work has shown that geometric programming can be a powerful framework
for multidisciplinary design optimization by leveraging the mathematical guarantees
and speed of convex optimization. However, there exists a variety of barriers for
implementing optimization in design. In this work, we formalize why the formulation
of general non-linear design problems as GPs facilitates design. We present methods
to convert non-linear constraints and data-based relations into GP-compatible forms
through the systematic formulation of an aircraft design problem,
and demonstrate the benefits of the non-convex extension of GPs called signomial programs (SPs).
The extensibility of GP models is demonstrated through a methodical expansion
in the fidelity of the model.
The features specific to GPkit, an object-oriented GP model formulation framework, in
facilitating the modern engineering design process are demonstrated.
Using both performance and mission modeling paradigms, we demonstrate the ability to
model and design complex systems in GP, and extract maximal engineering intuition
using sensitivities and tradespace exploration methods.
Though the methods are applied to an aircraft design problem, they are general to
models with continuous, explicit constraints, and help lower the barriers to implementing
optimization in design.
